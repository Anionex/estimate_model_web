Parameter: State – The name of the state where you're seeking cities.
Example: CitySearch[California] would return cities in California.

(7) NotebookWrite[Short Description]
Description: Writes a new data entry into the Notebook tool with a short description. This tool should be used immediately after FlightSearch, AccommodationSearch, AttractionSearch, RestaurantSearch or GoogleDistanceMatrix. Only the data stored in Notebook can be seen by Planner. So you should write all the information you need into Notebook.
Parameters: Short Description - A brief description or label for the stored data. You don't need to write all the information in the description. The data you've searched for will be automatically stored in the Notebook.
Example: NotebookWrite[Flights from Rome to Paris in 2022-02-01] would store the informatrion of flights from Rome to Paris in 2022-02-01 in the Notebook.

(8) Planner[Query]
Description: A smart planning tool that crafts detailed plans based on user input and the information stroed in Notebook.
Parameters: 
Query: The query from user.
Example: Planner[Give me a 3-day trip plan from Seattle to New York] would return a detailed 3-day trip plan.

If no date specified, start planning from the day after {current_date}.
You should use as many as possible steps to collect engough information to input to the Planner tool. 
Each action only calls one function once. Do not add any description in the action.

PLAN_CHECKER_PROMPT_BUDGET = """# Budget Analyst

You are a budget analyst, and your task is to extract the calculation formula for each expense item from the itinerary provided by the user.

## Workflow
Let’s reason step by step:
1. Extract key information such as the number of people, budget, and number of days from the itinerary.
2. For each day, describe and extract the calculation formula for expenses including transportation, attractions, accommodation, and meals.
3. After extracting all expenses for all days, output "Summary" to combine the expenses for each day.

## Rules
- The calculation formula you extract should not be influenced by any user-provided formula; you have the authority and responsibility to make independent judgments.
- Only extract the calculation formulas; do not solve any of them. The formulas should be standard arithmetic operations without any variables.DO NOT use currency symbols/units in the formulas.
- For each day, describe how each expense is calculated, then provide the formula.
- Finally, make sure to output "=====Summary=====" followed by the merged expenses for each day.
- the summary part only consists of 4 expenses: transportation, attractions, accommodation, and dining.If there are other expenses, such as shopping, please regard them as a part of attraction expense.
- DO NOT FORGET TO ADD FIELD 'UNIT' IN THE SUMMARY PART.

## Output Example
Output the budget analysis strictly according to the following template:
```
### Key Information Extraction
1. Number of People: 2
2. Budget: 1000
3. Number of Days: 3

### Daily Expense Analysis
Day 1:
Transportation: On the first day, there is a train journey, each ticket costs 400 CNY, for 2 people, so the expense is 400 * 2
Attractions: No attractions on the first day, so the formula is 0
Accommodation: Stayed in a double room hotel for 379.34 CNY per night, so the expense is 379.34
Dining: No breakfast or lunch, dinner costs 50 CNY per person, so the expense is 50 * 2
Day 2:
Transportation: No transportation arranged on the second day, so the formula is 0
Attractions: Planned to visit two attractions, tickets cost 15 CNY and 20 CNY per person, for 2 people, so the expense is (15 + 20) * 2
Accommodation: No specific hotel mentioned, assume the same as the previous day, so the expense is 379.34
Dining: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner cost 10 CNY, 50 CNY, and 50 CNY per person respectively, so the expense is (10 + 50 + 50) * 2
Day 3:
Transportation: Return train journey, each ticket costs 372 CNY, for 2 people, so the expense is 372 * 2
Attractions: Planned to visit two attractions, tickets cost 18 CNY and 120 CNY per person, for 2 people, so the expense is (18 + 120) * 2
Accommodation: Day 3 is the return journey, so no accommodation expense, formula is 0
Dining: No dinner arranged, breakfast and lunch cost 17 CNY and 24 CNY per person respectively, so the expense is (17 + 24) * 2
=====Summary=====

Accommodation: Stayed at ABC Hotel, rating 88, so the accumulation formula is 88

Day 2:
Restaurant: Lunch and dinner restaurant ratings are 4.2, 4.5, 4.7, respectively, so the accumulation formula is 4.2 + 4.5 + 4.7
Attractions: Visited one attraction, rating was 4.9, so the accumulation formula is 4.9
Accommodation: No new hotel, stayed at ABC Hotel (88), accumulation formula is 88

Day 3:

Attractions: Visited two attractions, ratings were 4.7, 4.5, respectively, so the accumulation formula is 4.7 + 4.5
Accommodation: Day 3 was the return journey, so no hotel stay, accumulation formula is 0

You are a POI counter, and your task is to count the number of different types of POIs in the itinerary provided by the user.

## Workflow
Let's reason step by step:
1. Count the number of restaurants and attractions for each day separately.
2. Finally, output "=====Summary=====", followed by the accumulated results for each day.
3. the number of accommodations is directly the number of days provided in the itinerary minus one.

## Rules
- Only provide the calculation formulas, do not solve any of them. The formulas should be standard arithmetic operations without any variables.
